# :book: SiteWhere User Guides

<Seo/>

The following guides provide detailed information about how SiteWhere is
architected, deployed and configured.

## :book: Architecture Guide

This guide covers core concepts of the SiteWhere 2.0 architecture and is intended
to provide an understanding of how the system works at a low level. While knowledge
of these concepts is not required for deploying and configuring a SiteWhere instance,
it does provide a basis for grasping how various parts of the system interact.

See the [guide](./architecture/) for more information.

## :book: Deployment Guide

This guide covers the process of deploying SiteWhere including
infrastructure components (e.g. Zookeeper, Kafka), data persistence
technologies (e.g. MongoDB, Cassandra) and SiteWhere microservices.
Included are best practices for deploying systems for various scenarios
such as local development, basic cloud deployments and large
highly-available deployments for applications such as smart cities.

See the [guide](./deployment/) for more information.

## :book: Device Interaction Guides

This group of guides covers various SiteWhere technologies that support
interactions with external devices. The guides include coverage of
platform integrations such as Eclipse Kura and openHAB as well
as SDKs for technologies suchs as Android and iOS. They also cover
specific device integrations such as Arduino and commercial,
off-the-shelf solutions.

See the [guide](./devices/) for more information.

## :book: Microservice Guides

This group of guides covers the SiteWhere microservices in depth including
aspects such as microservice configuration, Kafka interactions and available
microservice-specific APIs.

See the [guide](./microservices/) for more information.

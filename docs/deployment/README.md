# SiteWhere Deployment Guide

This guide covers the SiteWhere 2.0 deployment process which has changed
significantly from the one used for SiteWhere 1.x. While previous versions
of SiteWhere were deployed as a single server node, the SiteWhere 2.0
architecture is based on many microservices which are deployed into a
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) infrastructure.
